# MLOps Spam Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a Spam Detection Machine Learning model using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression.  
The model is exposed as a REST API using Flask and containerized using Docker.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Flask
- Docker
- GitHub

---

## Model Details
- Text Vectorization: TF-IDF
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Dataset: SMS Spam Collection Dataset

---

## How to Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train model:
   python train.py

3. Run Flask app:
   python app.py

## Model Performance

The spam classifier was evaluated on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.

| Metric | Score |
|---|---:|
| Accuracy | 96.8% |
| F1-score | 0.86 |

The model uses TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression for spam
classification.
